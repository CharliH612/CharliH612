- 👋 Hi, I’m @CharliH612, you can call me Charli
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code/program using JavaScript, Python CSS and HTML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use these languages in a real world application. I'm hoping that learning these skills will lead to career opportunites in the future for my family. 
- 💞️ I can't say I can collab on anything currently, unless you want to teach me some tricks of the trade
- 📫 How to reach me at Nealdevereux713@gmail.com this is a burner email account I use, I'm not sure why anyone would need to contact me privately, but if you feel the need, make sure to put something relevant in the subject line.
